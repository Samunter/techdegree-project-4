# techdegree-project-4 Object Oriented Programming Game

This project uses javascript to create a game that responds to user interaction
and reveals letters in a hidden phrase. The user can type on their keyboard or
click keys on an onscreen keyboard. It displays a winning screen when all
letters are revealed, and a losing screen when the user guesses 5 wrong letters.
The winning/losing screen allows the player to restart the game, where the game
is reset and a new hidden phrase is populated to the screen.

The following changes were made to the CSS styles:
Background color of start screen
Background color of lose screen
Background color of win screen
Color of wrong letter key
Added transition between hide and show letters
Background color of revealed letters in phrase
Added spacing between rows of letters (when phrase spans multiple lines)
Changed font family
